## About The Project
The main purpose of this app is to streamline prenatal care by providing a platform for doctors to efficiently manage pregnant women's patient details and appointment schedules. It aims to ensure pregnant women receive timely reminders for their upcoming visits, promoting consistent prenatal care attendance. Additionally, the app serves as an educational resource, offering curated trimester-specific videos covering various aspects of pregnancy and childbirth. By centralizing patient information and educational content, the app facilitates better communication and engagement between healthcare providers and pregnant women.

Moreover, this app is designed to operate seamlessly even in areas with limited internet connectivity, making it accessible to rural communities and villages where access to healthcare resources may be scarce. By functioning offline, the app ensures that pregnant women in remote areas can still receive important reminders for their prenatal appointments and access educational content without relying on consistent internet access. This offline capability extends the reach of maternal healthcare services, empowering healthcare providers to deliver essential care and education to underserved populations, ultimately contributing to improved maternal and child health outcomes in rural areas.

Ultimately, it seeks to enhance maternal health outcomes by empowering both doctors and pregnant women with valuable tools and resources throughout the pregnancy journey.
